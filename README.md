# OAuth API Twitter Bot
Another twitter bot(major improvement over the last one) but with much more added functionalities and more secure.

## Technical Description:
* A simple bot written in python which makes use of tweepy and twitter's OAuth API.
* All the operations which are done are natively supported by the twitter's API but we're using an external library for simplicity, ease of use, understanding and modification.
* Consists of different functions, each doing a specific task hence it can easily be understood.
* If you want to extend just make another function that does something `productive`.
* You can apply for Twitter Developer Account via their site.
* This bot is hosted and should work if you mention it(by adding @usbot899) in your tweet.
* It will tweet back at you by thanking you for mentioning it.
* It will also like and retweet your original tweet.
* Please contact me if it doesn't reply in 5-10 minutes(It's this slow on purpose)
* Please use a spare Twitter account if you're going to use this as this is experimental.

## Notes:
* The last_id.txt is used to store the Id of the last processed tweet so that we don't have to go through it again.
* The keys_format.py gives the format of the file keys.py which should contain all 4 of your keys in the specified way.
* The sleep time should be a little high or else the app or bot will be considered as a spam bot and it may get blocked.

## Functionalities:
It can be used to do the following activities:
* To follow all the users that follow you
* To like specific tweets
* To retweet specific tweets
* To follow a specific hashtag or string
